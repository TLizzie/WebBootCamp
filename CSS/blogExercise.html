		<p class = "quote">For those writers who have writers' block, this can be an excellent way to take a step to crumbling those walls. By taking the writer away from the subject matter that is causing the block, a random sentence may allow them to see the project they're working on in a different light and perspective. Sometimes all it takes is to get that first sentence down to help break the block.</p>

		<p>It can also be successfully used as a daily exercise to get writers to begin writing. Being shown a random sentence and using it to complete a paragraph each day can be an excellent way to begin any writing session.</p>

		<p>Random sentences can also spur creativity in other types of projects being done. If you are trying to come up with a new concept, a new idea or a new product, a random sentence may help you find unique qualities you may not have considered. Trying to incorporate the sentence into your project can help you look at it in different and unexpected ways than you would normally on your own.</p>
